# keyboard-break

Just a small script to have a count about the number of key you pressed from your keyboard today :D

## Licence

You are free to modify and distribute the code.

## installation

clone this repo somewhere on your desktop, then,

```
yarn install
```
or
```
npm install
```

## running the app

There is a vb script to make things simple. Just double click the script to run the app.
You should see the count at the bottom of the screen.
Every time you press a key on your keyboard, the count goes up. When it reaches 500 characters the counter becomes red, this simply means you have to take a BREAK ! (avoid having RSI ...)

## further

- If you want to modify the 500 alert threshold, modify the value in the `index.html` file (line 44).
- If you want to close the application you can press ctrl + w or just close the icon in the app bar.
